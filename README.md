## Overview
The Surf_Up analysis seeks to analyze weather for several years to determine if establishing a surfing business in oahu is viable. In this analysis, we woud utilize Jupyter notebook, a SQLite database, and VSCode where we will create our flask application to visualize the results of our analysis.

In the second part of our analysis, we will produce queries that show summary statistics for weather parameters for the months of June and December for multiple years.
